<b>2. Significant Uses of Different Parts of Speech</b><br>

<b>c. "Weave their air threads into woof as I listen to the patter of the rain overhead"</b><br>
This metaphor describes how intangible thoughts (“air threads”) are interlaced into a tapestry (“woof”) of memories and dreams. The rain acts as the loom, guiding the formation of this internal mental fabric.<br><br>
