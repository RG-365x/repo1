The greatest Tsunami in history

<h4>
The Boxing Day tsunami would be the deadliest in recorded history, taking a staggering 230,000 lives in a matter of hours. 
The city of Banda Aceh on the northern tip of Sumatra was closest to the powerful earthquake's epicenter and the
first waves arrived in just 20 minutes.
