<h1>Minecraft: Brewing stand recipes</h1>
<h2>
Brewing is something very important in minecraft. Brewing is used to make potions such as splash potions and lingering potions. These potions will be 
very useful while playing on servers.
</h2>
<h4>Every potion needs to be made using a brewing stand. The crafting recipe for a brewing stand needs 3 cobblestone and 1 blaze rod. 
<br/>
To start brewing, we need blaze powder for the fuel. Potions such as Night vision, Strength, Invisibility, etc. are made using an akward potion and another ingredient
(nether wart, ghast tear, golden carrot, etc.). We make an akward potion usng a water bottle and a nether wart. Splash potions can be made by adding gunpowder and
lingering potions by adding dragon's breath.</h4>
<br/>
<h3>After making an akward potion AND adding another ingredient, adding redstone dust will increase the time limit of the potion while adding glowstone dust will decrease
the time limit but make the potion more powerful.</h3>
