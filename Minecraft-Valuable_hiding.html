<h1>How to hide valuables quickly & efficiently in Minecraft</h1>
<br/>
<h3>If you're playing on a server in Minecraft, then there will always be someone who wants to steal your valuables<br/>
such as your Emeralds, Gold, Diamonds, and Netherite. Today, let's look at some of the clever ways to hide valuables. </h3>
<br/>
<p>
<h4>
1. Unexpected areas
</h4>
Everyone would think that there is nothing under the ground. Start by crafting your valuables into blocks. Dig out a small 2-block-deep patch in the ground.
Fill 1 layer of the patch with your valuables. Then repair the rest of the patch with dirt. No one would ever know it was there!
<h4>
2. Under the cauldron
</h4>
Many players use cauldrons as a sink. It would be less unlikely for a player to hide valuables under the cauldron. Put a barrel under the cauldron because a
chest would be obstructed by the cauldron. With only very less gap between the cauldron and the ground, players would not notice the barrel.

<h4>
3. In the furnace
</h4>
Most players have a smelting room- to smelt ores. In one furnace of yours, put the valuables in the output slot. No player would go checking the furnaces-
not even one!
