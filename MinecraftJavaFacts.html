<h1>Useful facts about Minecraft java</h1>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
1. If you've ever worried about fuel for cooking in Minecraft, don't worry. All you need is 3 wood, 3 sticks and 1 coal to make a campfire, through which
 you can cook items by placing the food on the campfire. If you've accidentally extinguished it, all you need is a silk touch pickaxe or a flint and steel. 
<br/>
<br/>
2. There is also a way to get already cooked food. We do this by using flint and steel on the animals. Eventually it will break, but it is still useful.
<br/>
<br/>
3. If you've always kept thinking that smelting ores in Minecraft takes too long, Always use a blast furnace. You can craft one if you have
 3 smooth stone, 5 iron ingots, and 1 furnace.
<br/>
<br/>
4. Have you ever thought that having to craft new tools because the old ones broke? Well, don't worry. If you have 2 oak planks, 2 sticks, and 1 stone 
slab, you can craft grindstone, through which you can repair your tools.
<br/>
<br/>
5. Thinking what fuel to use while smelting? Coal? No! Coal blocks are better. Coal can smelt 8 items, and a coal block can smelt 80 items. But,
you only need 9 blocks to craft a coal block instead of 10, Which thus means that you are saving coal!
<br/>
<br/>
6. Have you ever thought"Diamond pickaxe or gold pickaxe"? Well, we all know that a gold pickaxe mines pretty fast when compares to a diamond pickaxe.
However, it really breaks too quickly. But, both mine the same whrn the diamond pickaxe is enchanted with effeciency. Considering the fact that gold
is hard to find, I recommend using the diammond pickaxe with effeciency.
