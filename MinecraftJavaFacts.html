<h2>Cooking & Smelting</h2>
<br/>
1. If you've ever worried about fuel for cooking in Minecraft, don't worry. All you need is 3 wood, 3 sticks and 1 coal to make a campfire, through which
 you can cook items by placing the food on the campfire. If you've accidentally extinguished it, all you need is a silk touch pickaxe or a flint and steel. 
<br/>
<br/>
2. There is also a way to get already cooked food. We do this by using flint and steel on the animals. Eventually it will break, but it is still useful.
<br/>
<br/>
3. If you've always kept thinking that smelting ores in Minecraft takes too long, Always use a blast furnace. You can craft one if you have
 3 smooth stone, 5 iron ingots, and 1 furnace.
<br/>
<br/>
4. Have you ever thought that having to craft new tools because the old ones broke? Well, don't worry. If you have 2 oak planks, 2 sticks, and 1 stone 
slab, you can craft grindstone, through which you can repair your tools.
<br/>
<br/>
5. Thinking what fuel to use while smelting? Coal? No! Coal blocks are better. Coal can smelt 8 items, and a coal block can smelt 80 items. But,
you only need 9 blocks to craft a coal block instead of 10, Which thus means that you are saving coal!

<h2>Tools & mining<h2>
<br/>
<br/>
6. Have you ever thought"Diamond pickaxe or gold pickaxe"? Well, we all know that a gold pickaxe mines pretty fast when compares to a diamond pickaxe.
However, it really breaks too quickly. But, both mine the same whrn the diamond pickaxe is enchanted with effeciency. Considering the fact that gold
is hard to find, I recommend using the diammond pickaxe with effeciency.
<br/>
<br/>
7. If you personally like using gold tools, then you might be mining/using a ton of gold. A way to save gold is smelting it into gold nuggets just as it is about to
break. This way, after using 27 gold pickaxes and making gold nuggets, you will end up saving enough gold to get another gold pickaxe. The process might
be saving less gold at a time, but something is better than nothing!
<br/>
<br/>
8. Have you ever crafted diamond armour and then netherite armour and thought the diamond armour is a waste? Not really. Considering the fact that armour
needs  24 of that item, Smithing tables are our friends. A smithing table can be used for converting a perce of armour into the next level using one ingot 
of that. This means we need 24 diamonds and 4 netherite ingots to get full netherite.
<br/>
<br/>
9. Have you wanted to fool your friends saying that you have netherite tools? This can be done by enchanting stone tools. The shine given after the 
enchantment gives the effect of netherite tools. Pretty cool huh?
